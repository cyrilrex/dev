This directory is reserved for styling blocks - either global styling for .block
or its subsets, or for more specific styling for individual blocks - perhaps
a search block in the header.

If styling individual blocks, please try to name files in this folder with the
class of the block you are styling. For example, if you are styling a search
block, your file name will be something along the lines of
_block-search-block.scss
