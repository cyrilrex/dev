This directory is reserved for styling view-modes.

This is the most sustainable way to style a Drupal site that we have so far
adopted.

We create one file per view mode in this directory.

If styling for one specific item in one specific content type is needed, feel
free to use the content-types directory. But if possible, all stying for each
view mode should be in this directory.
