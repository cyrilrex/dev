This directory is used to store template files for content types.

All files in this directory should have a file name structure such as

node--[content-type]--[view-mode].html.twig (node--blog-post--full.html.twig)

Templates for view modes (to be used for all content types) are stored in the
view-modes directory.

You can get default templates to work with/override from the 'Classy' theme's
templates folder - /core/themes/classy/templates
